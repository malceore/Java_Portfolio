-Get functional test for API to create entities, do one entity at a time and prove that they are correct.
-Then when he actually publishes the only important part, the test script which he should publish at the start otherwise how can we even know 
	if what we are doing is correct(?), then we can copy the CLI from the model class and modify it for our needs. Realy code reuse here.
-Then we just need to get the CLI, File reader and API working as designed, Ie against the test file.
-Finally we need to fluff out comments, recheck dd with changes and test packaging.
